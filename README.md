# transfer-learning-image-classification
# Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using transfer learning with the VGG16 model in PyTorch. The pretrained VGG16, originally trained on ImageNet, was fine-tuned to adapt to grayscale clothing images by modifying its input channels and replacing the final classification layer. The entire workflow—loading data, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction—was implemented in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to run and experiment with.
